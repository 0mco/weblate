Whiteboard messages
===================

You can use whiteboard messages to give some information to your translators.
The message can be site-wide or targeted on translation component or language.

This can be useful for various things from announcing purpose of the website to
specifying targets for translations.

The whiteboard can currently be specified only in the admin interface:
