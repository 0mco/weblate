Administration
==============

Administration of Weblate is done through standard Django admin interface,
which is available under :file:`/admin/` URL.

.. _fulltext:

Fulltext search
---------------

Fulltext search is based on Whoosh. You can either allow Weblate to directly
update index on every change to content or offload this to separate process by 
:setting:`OFFLOAD_INDEXING`.

The first approach (immediate updates) allows more up to date index, but
suffers locking issues in some setup (eg. Apache's mod_wsgi) and produces more
fragmented index.

Offloaded indexing is always better choice for production setup - it only marks
which items need to be reindexed and you need to schedule background process 
(:djadmin:`update_index`) to update index. This leads to faster response of the
site and less fragmented index with cost that it might be slightly outdated.
