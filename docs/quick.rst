Quick starting guide
====================

.. note::

    This is just a quick guide for installing and starting to use Weblate,
    please check :ref:`install` for more detailed instructions.

Installing from sources
-----------------------

#. Install all required dependencies, see :ref:`requirements`.

#. Grab Weblate sources (either using Git or download a tarball) and unpack 
   them.

#. Edit :file:`settings.py` to match your setup. You will at least need to
   configure database connection (possibly adding user and creating the 
   database). Check :ref:`config` for Weblate specific configuration options.

#. Build Django tables and initial data:

   .. code-block:: sh

        ./manage.py syncdb
        ./scripts/generate-locales # If you are using Git checkout

#. Configure webserver to serve Weblate, see :ref:`server`.


Using prebuilt appliance
------------------------

#. Download the appliance and start it. You need to choose format depending on
   your target environment.

#. Everything should be set up immediatelly after boot, though you will want
   to adjust some settings to improve security, see :ref:`appliance`.


Adding translation
------------------

#. Open admin interface (http://example.org/admin/) and create project you
   want to translate. See :ref:`project` for more details.

#. Create subproject which is the real resource for translating - it points to
   Git repository and selects which files to translate. See :ref:`subproject`
   for more details.

#. Once above is completed (it can be lengthy process depending on size of
   your Git repository and number of messages to translate), you can start
   translating.
