Configuration
-------------

All settings are stored in :file:`settings.py` (as usual for Django).

.. envvar:: COMMIT_MESSAGE

    Message used on each commit Weblate does.

.. envvar:: ENABLE_HOOKS

    Whether to enable anonymous remote hooks.

    .. seealso:: :ref:`hooks`

.. envvar:: GIT_ROOT

    Path where Weblate will store cloned Git repositories. Defaults to
    :file:`repos` subdirectory.

.. envvar:: LAZY_COMMITS

    Delay creating Git commits until this is necessary. This heavily reduces
    number of commits generated by Weblate at expense of temporarily not being
    able to merge some changes as they are not yet committed.

    .. seelaso: :ref:`lazy-commits`

.. envvar:: MT_APERTIUM_KEY

    API key for Apertium Web Service, you can register at http://api.apertium.org/register.jsp

.. envvar:: MT_MICROSOFT_KEY

    API key for Microsoft Translator service, you can register at http://www.bing.com/developers/createapp.aspx

.. envvar:: NEARBY_MESSAGES

    How many messages around current one to show during translating.

.. envvar:: SIMILAR_MESSAGES

    Number of similar messages to lookup. This is not a hard limit, just a
    number Weblate tries to find if it is possible.

.. envvar:: SITE_TITLE

    Site title to be used in website and emails as well.

.. envvar:: WHOOSH_INDEX

    Directory where Whoosh fulltext indices will be stored. Defaults to :file:`whoosh-index` subdirectory.
