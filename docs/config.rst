Configuration
=============

All settings are stored in :file:`settings.py` (as usual for Django).

.. setting:: CHECK_LIST

CHECK_LIST
----------

List of consistency checks to perform on translation.

.. seealso:: :ref:`checks`, :ref:`custom-checks`

.. setting:: ENABLE_HOOKS

ENABLE_HOOKS
------------

Whether to enable anonymous remote hooks.

.. seealso:: :ref:`hooks`

.. setting:: GIT_ROOT

GIT_ROOT
--------

Path where Weblate will store cloned Git repositories. Defaults to
:file:`repos` subdirectory.

.. setting:: LAZY_COMMITS

LAZY_COMMITS
------------

Delay creating Git commits until this is necessary. This heavily reduces
number of commits generated by Weblate at expense of temporarily not being
able to merge some changes as they are not yet committed.

.. seealso:: :ref:`lazy-commit`

.. setting:: MT_APERTIUM_KEY

MT_APERTIUM_KEY
---------------

API key for Apertium Web Service, you can register at http://api.apertium.org/register.jsp

.. setting:: MT_MICROSOFT_KEY

MT_MICROSOFT_KEY
----------------

API key for Microsoft Translator service, you can register at http://www.bing.com/developers/createapp.aspx

.. setting:: NEARBY_MESSAGES

NEARBY_MESSAGES
---------------

How many messages around current one to show during translating.

.. setting:: OFFLOAD_INDEXING

OFFLOAD_INDEXING
----------------

Offload updating of fulltext index to separate process. This heavily
improves responsiveness of online operation on expense of slightly
outdated index, which might still point to older content.

While enabling this, don't forget scheduling runs of 
:program:`./manage.py update_index` in cron or similar tool.

This is recommended setup for production use.

.. setting:: SIMILAR_MESSAGES

SIMILAR_MESSAGES
----------------

Number of similar messages to lookup. This is not a hard limit, just a
number Weblate tries to find if it is possible.

.. setting:: SITE_TITLE

SITE_TITLE
----------

Site title to be used in website and emails as well.

.. setting:: WHOOSH_INDEX

WHOOSH_INDEX
------------

Directory where Whoosh fulltext indices will be stored. Defaults to :file:`whoosh-index` subdirectory.
